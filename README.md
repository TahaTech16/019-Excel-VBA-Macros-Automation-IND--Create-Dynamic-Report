Looking for a sample report format (a single-tab Excel layout) that you can use to begin automating tasks using VBA Macrosâ€”such as:

Sales report generation

Pivot table creation

Looping through files from a folder using OpenFileFromFolder logic

Applying transformations or extracting data from each file
